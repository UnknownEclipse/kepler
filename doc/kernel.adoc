= Kernel Design and Documentation

This document describes the design of Kepler's kernel and structure. In keeping with
the 'orbital mechanics' theme, the kernel is called `Sol`. Structures are described
using simple C types and functions, as the focus is on the objects and functions 
themselves. Safe APIs will be provided in the userspace runtime.
